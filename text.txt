i want my snake increase size if i sucessfully eat food and update the score
i want message display clearly as game over  if snake hit any edge or hit it self 
i want play again botton visiable right  below the score botton to re-start the game.



//HTMl code
create a h1 tage with game name
create div element to  declaire the cells


// css coding
make body take as flex box to aline every element to center 
use some color and background-color property to make cell more clear. 


//js code
select the game board element using DOM
-> state 
    declaire the snake's intial position
    declaire the direction 
    declaire food position (as random- computer pick using math.random() should not equal to snake positionmethod)
    declaire game status (as false )

loop
update the snake position
    check the collision
    - if snake head touch the edge of board than set game status to true
    - if snake head collides with his body than set game status to true
    check if snake eat the food
    - if true than grow the snake size by 1 cell (adding position at first index of array)
    -generate a new food position
    -update the score

dom-event listener
    - change the snake direction based on user input which would be arrow key from user key board

display final result when game is over
